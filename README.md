# Coding-Exercise---ML-Basics

All coding files are in here. The annual spending purchase frequency data was for the customer segmentation. It was downloaded as a fake data set form chatgpt. The other two used datasets that are linked in the code itsel under a comment. For the Cusotmer Churn I used a kaggle dataset and for the houses prices based on location, square ft, etc. I googled Evergreen, San Jose and used the first houses that appeared on the screen.
